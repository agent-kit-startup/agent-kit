description: Bootstrap a plan with to-dos from any user payload, with two HITL gates.
---

# Command: /start-project

## Goal

Bootstrap a **plan with to-dos** from any user payload. This command does **not** mean "start coding."

## When to Use

- First time using Agent Kit
- When there is no active plan or Context Pack  
- When you want to start a **new** project/task

## Hard stops (kit failure if skipped)

These are non-negotiable in manual mode:

1. **Broad Intake Review first.** Before proposing or writing a plan, run the Broad Intake Review (see below) to scan active session, plans, memory, docs, git state, and product version. Use findings for conflict triage.
2. **Plan file before any product edit.** Do not modify agents, skills, rules, app code, registry, or docs-of-record while creating the plan. Allowed writes in the bootstrap turn: the new `.cursor/plans/*.plan.md` and updated HANDOFF reflecting the chosen disposition for any prior active plan (backlog or park).
3. **Goal in the same message is not execute permission.** `/start-project scan the repo and fix X` still goes through the gates below. Never jump to Explore → Edit.
4. **Two gates, two user "yes" answers:**
   - **Gate A (approve plan):** propose phases/to-dos → write the plan file → stop and ask using **Ask questions** tool.
   - **Gate B (approve first unit):** only after Gate A is accepted → run **one** phase or one heavy to-do → update HANDOFF → stop again.
5. **Forbidden phrasing / behavior:** "I'll create a plan and start Phase 1", chaining Gate A+B in one turn, or running the whole plan unless the user explicitly used `/run-plan`.

## Prepared repository contract

Before intake, read `.cursor/agent-kit.config.json` and `.cursor/context/readiness.json`.

**Planning blockers** (stop and point to `/agent-kit-onboard`; do not resolve setup here):

- Derive unresolved essentials from `pillars[].checks[]` where `essential: true` and `status` is not `ready`. Preserve report order.
- Do **not** treat `pendingActions` as an essential-only queue. Non-essential pending items (for example `collaboration.provider` / action `confirm-provider`) are **warnings only**: mention once, continue Broad Intake, and do not halt planning.
- Missing readiness or config files, unsupported snapshot schema, or a fingerprint mismatch that invalidates the snapshot: point to `/agent-kit-onboard`. Do not reconstruct onboarding inside `/start-project`.

**When essentials are ready** (non-essential pending allowed):

- Reuse verified purpose, stack, Git, context, and validation facts. Do not ask the user to confirm them again.
- Ask only for the deliverable goal. Repository purpose is setup context, not the goal of the new plan.
- Gate A and Gate B remain mandatory; readiness does not skip HITL.

## Broad Intake Review (required before plan proposal)

> **Delegation note:** The actual bucket scanning below is performed by a **Task(explore) subagent** dispatched from Step 1. The table defines the specification of what the worker scans. See Step 1 for the delegation pattern.

Before proposing or writing a new plan, **scan** these sources (read/skim; do not deep-dive every file) and use findings for conflict triage:

| Bucket | What to check | How / typical paths |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Prepared repository** | Verified profile and readiness state | `.cursor/agent-kit.config.json`, `.cursor/context/readiness.json` |
| **Active session** | HANDOFF, Context Pack | `.cursor/HANDOFF.md`, `.cursor/context/current/` |
| **Plans** | In-progress + recent parked/related | `.cursor/plans/*.plan.md` (status in frontmatter) |
| **Archived context** | Prior packs for same theme | `.cursor/context/archive/**` (if present; glob by topic) |
| **Decisions** | ADRs that constrain the goal | `.cursor/memory/decisions/`, `_index.md` Decisions table |
| **Memory** | Errors, audits, consolidations, review logs, plan-monitors, findings audits | `.cursor/memory/errors/`, `.cursor/memory/plan-monitor-*.md`, theme-matched `plan-review-*.md`, `_index.md` (Audits + Decisions) |
| **Unprocessed dogfood** | Factory/consumer inbox notes awaiting triage (not sessionStart-only) | `dogfood/README.md` or `.cursor/dogfood/README.md` under `##` or `### Unprocessed Files`; skim titles/summaries only. Missing/empty inbox → no findings. Labels: ignore (owned by open plan), error/include (kit gap), note (inbox evidence only). Never auto-analyze or memory WRITE (ADR `decisions/2026-08-11_dogfood-unprocessed-broad-intake-bucket.md`) |
| **Local docs** | SoT / inventories / getting-started that the goal touches | `docs/**`, especially files named in the payload or related SoT |
| **Working tree** | Uncommitted local work that would collide | `git status`, `git diff` (staged + unstaged); do not commit |
| **Recent commits** | What already shipped for this theme | `git log` (short, recent), related PR titles if available |
| **Product version** | Avoid stale version prose | `package.json`, `CHANGELOG.md` `[Unreleased]` / latest |

**Triage labels** (every relevant finding gets one):

- **ignore**: already a future/pending to-do on an active or parked plan; leave for `/continue-plan`. For plan-monitors: owned by another open plan, or already triaged clean (`## Triage note` / follow-up / residuals-plan heading)
- **error**: completed work that overreached, contradicted HITL, or left a verifiable residual → **include** in the new plan. For plan-monitors: GAP or regression vs claimed-complete work
- **include**: new scope from the user payload, or residual not owned by another plan. For plan-monitors: open residual not owned by an active/backlog plan
- **note**: operational gap (e.g. monitor misses tags); record in plan Constraints / Acceptance or memory, no code unless asked. For plan-monitors: outdated vs HEAD, freshness caveat, or staging-hygiene risk (dirty untracked monitors)

Do not invent a fifth triage label. Field Report and `/plan-review-triage` remain attention/HITL SoT; Broad Intake consults monitors as evidence only (ADR `decisions/2026-07-27_plan-monitor-consumer-awareness.md`).

## What to Do

### Step 1: Broad Intake Review (delegated)

The actual scanning and triage is delegated to a **Task(explore) subagent** using the worker prompt template at `.cursor/context/templates/command-worker-prompt.md`.

1. **Fill the template** — set these parameters:
   - **Repo:** `[absolute repo path]`
   - **Command:** `/start-project`
   - **Task description:** "Scan the Broad Intake buckets listed in this command (prepared repository, active session, plans, archived context, decisions, memory, Unprocessed dogfood, local docs, working tree, recent commits, product version) and return a structured triage report with findings per bucket, each labeled ignore/error/include/note. For Unprocessed dogfood: skim `dogfood/README.md` or `.cursor/dogfood/README.md` `##` or `### Unprocessed Files` only; never auto-analyze."
   - **read_scope:** `[".cursor/agent-kit.config.json", ".cursor/context/readiness.json", ".cursor/HANDOFF.md", ".cursor/context/current/", ".cursor/plans/*.plan.md", ".cursor/context/archive/**", ".cursor/memory/decisions/", ".cursor/memory/errors/", ".cursor/memory/plan-monitor-*.md", ".cursor/memory/plan-review-*.md", ".cursor/memory/_index.md", "dogfood/README.md", ".cursor/dogfood/README.md", "docs/**", "package.json", "CHANGELOG.md"]`
   - **worker_contract:** "structured triage report: list of findings per bucket with triage labels (ignore/error/include/note)"
   - **max_ticks:** 2

2. **Dispatch** a Task subagent with `subagent_type: explore`.

3. **Read the worker summary** — the main window uses the triage findings for conflict triage in Step 2 (vague goals) and Step 3 (Gate A).

**Fallback:** If Task dispatch is unavailable, run the Broad Intake Review inline (same as pre-delegation behavior).

### Step 2: Handle vague goals

If the goal is missing or vague, use **Ask questions** tool (fallback to chat if tool unavailable):
> "What's the goal of your project? (1-2 sentences)"

Wait for answer before proceeding.

### Step 3: Gate A (design only)

1. **Propose phases and to-dos** based on the goal and Broad Intake findings. Align with `autogit/plan-routine.md` and `.cursor/context/templates/plan.md`.

2. **Ask one composite Gate A question** using **Ask questions** tool (fallback to chat if tool unavailable — render one numbered list per message). If an active plan exists, the options merge disposition and write into a single pick:

   > "Write this plan to `.cursor/plans/[name].plan.md` (to-dos in frontmatter, no coding yet)?"

   **With active plan** — composite options:
   | Option | Disposition | Action | Gate B |
   |--------|-------------|--------|--------|
   | `Write plan and add to backlog (keep current active)` | backlog | write plan file | skipped |
   | `Park current plan, write plan and activate new` | park | write plan file | follows |
   | `Modify proposal first` | — | — | — |
   | `Cancel` | — | abort | — |

   **No active plan** — options:
   | Option | Action | Gate B |
   |--------|--------|--------|
   | `Write plan file` | write plan file and activate | follows |
   | `Write plan and add to backlog` | write plan file; list under Backlog plans; Mode STOPPED | skipped |
   | `Modify proposal first` | — | — |
   | `Cancel` | abort | — |

3. **On approval:** create the plan file. Update HANDOFF per the chosen disposition (park, backlog, or activate). Backlog path (with active plan, or no-active-plan `Write plan and add to backlog`): plan listed under "Backlog plans", Mode STOPPED (or current plan stays active when disposing a prior active plan), skip Gate B. Park path: new plan active, phase none / awaiting Gate B. Activate path (`Write plan file` with no prior active plan): new plan active, then Gate B.

4. **Stop and ask for Gate B** (park path or no-active-plan activate path only) using **Ask questions** tool (fallback to chat if tool unavailable, one list per message):
   > "Plan ready: `[path]`. First unit would be `[to-do-id]` only (manual = one phase per chat)."
   
   Options: `Start first unit` / `Switch to /run-plan` / `Edit plan first` / `Add to backlog` / `Stop here`

   | Option | Effect |
   |--------|--------|
   | `Start first unit` | run one unit (Gate B proceed) |
   | `Switch to /run-plan` | continuous mode for this plan |
   | `Edit plan first` | revise plan; re-ask Gate B later |
   | `Add to backlog` | list under Backlog plans; Mode STOPPED; unit not started |
   | `Stop here` | plan stays **active**; unit not started (not backlog) |

   On any backlog path (Gate A or Gate B `Add to backlog`), skip or exit Gate B: report the plan location and stop (resume via `/continue-plan` or activate later). `Add to backlog` is distinct from `Stop here`.
### Step 4: Gate B (first unit only, after explicit approval)

1. Mark the to-do `in_progress`, do **only** that unit.
2. Mark it `completed`, update HANDOFF, suggest `/git-staging` if there is a diff.
3. Stop. Do not start the next phase in this chat (manual mode).

### Step 5: Footer (informational only)

After proposing the plan, list any in-progress or parked plans in one short block:

> **Other plans:** [plan names and status]: Use `/continue-plan` to resume.

## Ask questions requirement

**Active-plan disposition, Gate A, Gate B, and vague-goal clarification MUST use Ask questions tool** (`AskQuestion` / ACP `cursor/ask_question`) instead of chat prompts like "type yes to continue." This opens clickable options in the IDE UI.

**Requirements:**
1. Use **Ask questions** for any confirmation, choice among options, or clarification before acting
2. Prefer one question at a time (or small coherent set if the product allows multi-question)  
3. Options must be concrete labels (e.g. `Write plan file`, `Start first unit`, `Skip for now`)
4. **Fallback:** if the tool is not available in the current session, say so once and ask the same options in chat

**Note:** Kit-wide contract: always-applied L0 rule [`.cursor/rules/hitl-ask-questions.mdc`](../rules/hitl-ask-questions.mdc).

## Onboarding flow (correct)

```
User: /start-project Build an authentication API with JWT  
Agent: [Broad Intake Review] No conflicts found.
       Proposed plan:
       0. Project setup
       1. Login/register  
       2. JWT access + refresh
       3. Auth middleware
       4. Tests
       [Ask questions: Write plan? Options: Write plan file / Write plan and add to backlog / Modify first / Cancel]
User: [clicks Write plan file]
Agent: [Writes plan + HANDOFF only] Plan ready.
       [Ask questions: Start "phase0-setup" only? Options: Start first unit / Switch to run-plan / Edit first / Add to backlog / Stop here]
User: [clicks Start first unit]  
Agent: [Does phase0 only] -> HANDOFF -> stops; suggests /git-staging if diff
```

Backlog path (Gate A or Gate B): plan file exists under `.cursor/plans/`, listed on HANDOFF Backlog, Mode STOPPED; no first-unit execution until the operator activates it later.

Wrong (do not do this):

```
User: /start-project ainda tem PT no repo, deixe EN
Agent: Scanning... creating plan and starting Phase 1... [edits files]
```

## Tip

If the user is unsure:
> "Not sure yet? Tell me a bit about what you want to build and we'll figure it out together."

Manual mode default: one phase per chat after Gate B. Multi-phase in one window requires `/run-plan`.
