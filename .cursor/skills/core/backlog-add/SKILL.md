# /backlog-add

Enqueue a plan to backlog without activating it, after Broad Intake review and conflict triage.

## When to use

- Queue a plan for later work without making it the active plan
- Add a plan when the active plan should remain active
- Enqueue multiple plans in sequence
- Write residuals plans from `/plan-review-triage`

Do **not** use this for activating a plan (use `/start-project` with Gate B) or starting execution immediately (use `/continue-plan` or `/run-plan` after activation).

## Procedure
