# Docs & Repo

Keep README, setup/runbooks, and ADRs current when behavior or architecture changes.

## Standard (required)

Documentation belongs to the **project**, not the chat or the author. Follow rule `docs-professional-standard`:

- Professional, inheritable voice (system behavior, not “today I…”)
- No transient references: people, unrelated projects, session drama, client-specific workspace IDs
- Timeless where possible; verify against code
- Inheritance test: a new maintainer can use it in 12 months without the chat

Also follow `agent-output-hygiene` (no agent metalinguage in artifacts).
